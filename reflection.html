    This class helped me understand the basic of coding. Also this class showed me how to use coding for things that I may need in the future. Using coding I can also mess with people which is very enjoyable.

    Minecraft coding was a fun and easy way to understand some of the basics. Binaryw as an interesting topic to learn as well because it is different from basic counting. Coding a website is a very important skill if you plan on making a business or other things.
